## Note on Sharing Project Euler Solutions Publicly ##

I have made this repository public, but will only include solutions I have to problems 1-100. Any code I write for later problems is stored in a separate private repository, in order to respect the wishes of those who run Project Euler. 

As of 12 October 2023, this is part of the FAQ on Project Euler's homepage:

***I learned so much solving problem XXX, so is it okay to publish my solution elsewhere?***

*...the rule about sharing solutions outside of Project Euler does not apply to the first one-hundred problems, as long as any discussion clearly aims to instruct methods, not just provide answers, and does not directly threaten to undermine the enjoyment of solving later problems. Problems 1 to 100 provide a wealth of helpful introductory teaching material and if you are able to respect our requirements, then we give permission for those problems and their solutions to be discussed elsewhere.*
